	 * "To pass this tutorial you need to create the following classes and add them to an
	 * appropriate package. Use the package and class names indicated in the screen shot below."

	 * In which case the InputOutput file was the only one missing, my Input and Output functions
	 * (or methods) are located at the bottom of the AppointmentFactory class, this was to ensure i

	 * <p>
	 * This class was included just in-case it was needed to actually pass the Tutorial
